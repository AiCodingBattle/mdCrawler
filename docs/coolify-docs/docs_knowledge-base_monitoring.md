# Monitoring â€‹
Coolify has a built-in monitoring system, which can be used to monitor your resources and send notifications to your team if something goes wrong.
Currently Coolify monitors the following resources:
  * Disk usage - If your disk usage is above the configured threshold, it does an automatic cleanup.
  * If any of your containers are stopped or restarted.
  * Backup status.
