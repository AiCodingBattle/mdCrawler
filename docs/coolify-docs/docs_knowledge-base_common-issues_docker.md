#### 1. Expired GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) â€‹
If you encounter the following errors, it means Docker cannot authenticate with the GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io):
**Error 1:**
sh```
 Error response from daemon: Head "https://ghcr.io/v2/coollabsio/coolify-helper/manifests/1.0.1": unauthorized: authentication required
```

**Error 2:**
sh```
 Unable to find image 'ghcr.io/coollabsio/coolify-helper:latest' locally
 docker: Error response from daemon: Head "https://ghcr.io/v2/coollabsio/coolify-helper/manifests/latest": denied: denied
```

To resolve this issue, you have two options:
  * Log out of GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) by running:
sh```
 docker logout ghcr.io
```

  * Renew your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) if you need to maintain authenticated access for deployments.
