## What is DragonFly ​
DragonFly is a modern in-memory datastore, designed as a Redis alternative with better scalability and resource efficiency. It offers a Redis-compatible API while providing improved performance on multi-core systems. DragonFly is built to handle high-throughput scenarios and large datasets more efficiently than traditional in-memory datastores.
With its multi-threaded architecture and advanced data structures, DragonFly aims to provide enhanced scalability and performance for applications that require Redis-like functionality on modern hardware.
