# Cloudflare R2 ​
Cloudflare R2 is an S3 compatible storage. You can use it with Coolify to store your backups.
# Configuration ​
  1. You need to create a bucket first in the Cloudflare R2 dashboard.
  2. Then you need to create a R2 API token with `Object Read & Write` permission.
  3. You can find the S3 client credentials when the token is created.
Tip
You will need the `Access Key ID`, `Secret Access Key` and the `S3 endpoint` from this view. Save them.
  4. You can use the details from the previous step to configure Coolify.
