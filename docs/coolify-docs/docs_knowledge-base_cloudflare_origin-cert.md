# Cloudflare Origin Certificate ​
![](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-origin-cert/header.webp)
The Cloudflare Origin Certificate ensures secure communication between your server and Cloudflare when using Cloudflare’s Proxy, CDN, and security features.
It encrypts the data exchanged between your server and Cloudflare, keeping it safe.
### Why Use Cloudflare Origin Certificate with Coolify? ​
  1. No need for HTTP or DNS challenges to create certificates.
  2. Keep port 80 closed — everything happens securely over TLS.
  3. Longer certificate validity (15 years) — once set up, you don’t need to worry about renewing every few months.


### When to Avoid Using Cloudflare Origin Certificate ​
  1. If you need a free certificate for subdomains with multiple levels (e.g., app.sub.domain.com).
  2. The certificate is only trusted by Cloudflare, meaning if Cloudflare is down, nobody can access your apps and websites (via your domain).


Example Data
The following data is used as an example in this guide. Please replace it with your actual data when following the steps:
  * **IPv4 Address of Origin Server:** 203.0.113.1
  * **Domain Name:** shadowarcanist.com
  * **Username:** shadowarcanist


## 1. Create the Origin Certificate ​
To create your Cloudflare Origin Certificate, follow these steps:
![](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-origin-cert/1.webp)
  1. In your Cloudflare dashboard, go to **SSL/TLS**.
  2. Select **Origin Server**.
  3. Click the **Create Certificate** button.


You’ll be asked to choose a private key type, hostnames, and certificate validity.
![](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-origin-cert/2.webp)
  1. Choose **RSA (2048)** for the key type.
  2. Add the hostnames you want the certificate to cover.


HEADS UP!
  * **`shadowarcanist.com`**will cover only the main domain.
  * **`*.shadowarcanist.com`**will cover all subdomains.


On Cloudflare’s free plan, wildcard certificates cover just one level of subdomains
For example, it works for **`coolify.shadowarcanist.com`**but not**`www.coolify.shadowarcanist.com`**.
To cover multiple levels, you'll need to purchase the Advanced Certificate Manager ↗
  1. Set the certificate validity to **15 years**.


Your certificate will now be generated.
![](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-origin-cert/3.webp)
  1. Choose **PEM** as the key format.
  2. Copy your **Certificate**.
  3. Copy your **Private Key**.


Next, you'll add these to your server running Coolify and configure Coolify to use this certificate.
## 2. Add Certificate to Your Server ​
SSH into your server or use Coolify's terminal feature. For this guide, I’m using SSH:
sh```
ssh shadowarcanist@203.0.113.1
```

Once logged in, navigate to the Coolify proxy directory:
sh```
$ cd /data/coolify/proxy
```

Check if you have a **certs** folder:
sh```
$ ls
> acme.json docker-compose.yml dynamic
```

If there’s no **certs** folder, create it:
sh```
$ mkdir certs
```

Verify it was created:
sh```
$ ls
> acme.json certs docker-compose.yml dynamic
```

Now, navigate into the **certs** directory:
sh```
$ cd certs
```

Create two new files for the certificate and private key:
sh```
$ touch shadowarcanist.cert shadowarcanist.key
```

Verify the files were created:
sh```
$ ls
> shadowarcanist.cert shadowarcanist.key
```

Open the **shadowarcanist.cert** file and paste the certificate from the Cloudflare dashboard:
sh```
$ nano shadowarcanist.cert
```

Save and exit after pasting the certificate.
Do the same for the **shadowarcanist.key** file and paste the private key:
sh```
$ nano shadowarcanist.key
```

Save and exit.
Now the origin certificate is installed on your server.
## 3. Set Up DNS Records and TLS Encryption ​
To make the origin certificate work, configure your DNS records, enable TLS, and set up HTTP to HTTPS redirects in Cloudflare:
![](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-origin-cert/4.webp)
  1. In Cloudflare, go to **DNS**.
  2. Select **Records**.
  3. Add 2 A records:
  4. Enter name as **`shadowarcanist.com`**and`*`
  5. Use the **IP address** of your server as the content for both records.
  6. Set the proxy status to **Proxied** for better security.


Next, set up TLS encryption:
![](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-origin-cert/5.webp)
  1. Go to **SSL/TLS** in Cloudflare.
  2. Select **Overview**.
  3. Click **Configure** button


Choose **Full (Strict)** as the encryption mode.
![](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-origin-cert/6.webp)
Finally, enable HTTP to HTTPS redirects:
![](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-origin-cert/7.webp)
  1. In Cloudflare, go to **SSL/TLS**
  2. Select **Edge Certificates**.
  3. Enable **Always Use HTTPS**.


## 4. Configure Coolify to Use the Origin Certificate ​
Now, in your Coolify dashboard:
![](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-origin-cert/8.webp)
  1. Go to the **Server** section in the sidebar.
  2. Select **Proxy**.
  3. Open the **Dynamic Configuration** page
  4. Click **Add** button


You will now be prompted to enter the Dynamic Configuration.
![](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-origin-cert/9.webp)
  1. Choose a name for your configuration.
  2. Enter the following details in the configuration field:


sh```
tls:
 certificates:
  -
   certFile: /traefik/certs/shadowarcanist.cert
   keyFile: /traefik/certs/shadowarcanist.key
```

Adding Multiple Certificates (click to view)
sh```
tls:
 certificates:
  -
   certFile: /traefik/certs/shadowarcanist.cert
   keyFile: /traefik/certs/shadowarcanist.key
  -
   certFile: /traefik/certs/name2.cert
   keyFile: /traefik/certs/name2.key
  -
   certFile: /traefik/certs/name3.cert
   keyFile: /traefik/certs/name3.key
```

  1. Save the configuration


From now on, Coolify will use the origin certificate for requests matching the hostname.
HEADS UP!
**All the steps below are optional. Coolify should already be using the origin certificate. Follow these steps only if you know what you're doing and want to simplify the configuration**
## 5. Optional: Configure Traefik ​
This step is optional but recommended for cleaning up unnecessary settings while self-hosting.
Since you’re using an Origin Certificate, you no longer need HTTP challenges or port 80 open.
![](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-origin-cert/10.webp)
  1. Go **Server** in the Coolify dashboard.
  2. Select **Proxy**.
  3. Open **Configuration**.
  4. Replace the configuration with this:


sh```
# Define external networks
networks:
 coolify:
  external: true # External network.
services:
 # Traefik reverse proxy
 traefik:
  container_name: coolify-proxy # Container name.
  image: 'traefik:v3.1' # Traefik image version.
  restart: unless-stopped # Auto-restart policy.
  extra_hosts:
   - 'host.docker.internal:host-gateway' # Host communication.
  networks:
   - coolify # Network connection.
  ports:
   - '443:443' # Expose HTTPS port.
  healthcheck: # Health check configuration.
   test: 'wget -qO- http://localhost:80/ping || exit 1' # Ping endpoint for health check.
   interval: 4s # Health check interval.
   timeout: 2s # Health check timeout.
   retries: 5 # Retry attempts.
  volumes:
   - '/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro' # Docker socket access.
   - '/data/coolify/proxy:/traefik' # Traefik config volume.
  command:
   # Traefik configuration options
   - '--ping=true' # Enable ping for health check.
   - '--ping.entrypoint=http' # Use HTTP entrypoint for ping.
   - '--entrypoints.http.address=:80' # HTTP entry point for health checks.
   - '--entrypoints.https.address=:443' # HTTPS entry point.
   - '--entrypoints.http.http.encodequerysemicolons=true' # Enable query semicolon encoding.
   - '--entryPoints.http.http2.maxConcurrentStreams=50' # HTTP/2 max streams.
   - '--entrypoints.https.http.encodequerysemicolons=true' # Enable HTTPS query encoding.
   - '--entryPoints.https.http2.maxConcurrentStreams=50' # HTTPS/2 max streams.
   - '--entrypoints.https.http3' # Enable HTTP/3.
   - '--providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false' # Disable default exposure.
   - '--providers.file.directory=/traefik/dynamic/' # Dynamic config directory.
   - '--certificatesresolvers.letsencrypt.acme.httpchallenge=false' # Disable HTTP challenge for Let's Encrypt.
   - '--providers.file.watch=true' # Enable config file watching.
   - '--providers.docker=true' # Enable Docker provider.
  labels:
   - coolify.managed=true # Managed by Coolify.
   - coolify.proxy=true # Proxy service.
```

Note
The comments in this configuration explain each line. You can remove the comments when copying it into your configuration.
Next, you'll need to remove a few labels from your Dockerfile-based deployments. Below is an **example** of how I set this up for my website.
![](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-origin-cert/11.webp)
  1. Go to **Projects** and select your project.
  2. Open **Configuration**
  3. Go to **General**
  4. Check **Readonly labels** option
  5. Replace the labels with the following:


sh```
# Enable Traefik for this configuration
traefik.enable=true
# Define the entry point for the router (HTTPS)
traefik.http.routers.shadowarcanist.entryPoints=https
# Set the routing rule for this router to match the domain "shadowarcanist.com" and any path starting with "/"
traefik.http.routers.shadowarcanist.rule=Host(`shadowarcanist.com`) && PathPrefix(`/`)
# Assign the service 'shadowarcanist' to this router
traefik.http.routers.shadowarcanist.service=shadowarcanist
# Enable TLS (HTTPS) for this router
traefik.http.routers.shadowarcanist.tls=true
# Specify the backend service and its port (port 80)
traefik.http.services.shadowarcanist.loadbalancer.server.port=80
```

Now you’re done! Your server is set up to use the Cloudflare Origin Certificate, and all traffic is secured via TLS.
Note
Keep in mind that the above labels are provided as an example. These may or may not work for your specific use case, so use them as a reference.
