# Dynamic Configurations â€‹
Dynamic configurations are used to configure Traefik on the fly, without restarting it.
You can add them by going to the `Server/Proxy` view, and select `Dynamic Configurations` from the sidebar.
Tip
Some of the dynamic configurations cannot be deleted, as they required for Coolify itself.
