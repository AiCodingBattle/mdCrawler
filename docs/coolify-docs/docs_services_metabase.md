## What is Metabase? ​
Metabase is the easy, open-source way for everyone in your company to ask questions and learn from data.
## Features ​
  * Set up in five minutes (we're not kidding).
  * Let anyone on your team ask questions without knowing SQL.
  * Use the SQL editor for more complex queries.
  * Build handsome, interactive dashboards with filters, auto-refresh, fullscreen, and custom click behavior.
  * Create models that clean up, annotate, and/or combine raw tables.
  * Define canonical segments and metrics for your team to use.
  * Send data to Slack or email on a schedule with dashboard subscriptions.
  * Set up alerts to have Metabase notify you when your data changes.
  * Embed charts and dashboards in your app, or even your entire Metabase.
