# Quickstart: Deploy on LangGraph CloudÂ¶
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
  * GitHub account
  * LangSmith account


## Create a repository on GitHubÂ¶
To deploy a LangGraph application to **LangGraph Cloud** , your application code must reside in a GitHub repository. Both public and private repositories are supported.
You can deploy any LangGraph Application to LangGraph Cloud.
For this guide, we'll use the pre-built Python **ReAct Agent** template.
Get Required API Keys for the ReAct Agent template
This **ReAct Agent** application requires an API key from Anthropic and Tavily. You can get these API keys by signing up on their respective websites.
**Alternative** : If you'd prefer a scaffold application that doesn't require API keys, use the **New LangGraph Project** template instead of the **ReAct Agent** template.
  1. Go to the ReAct Agent repository.
  2. Fork the repository to your GitHub account by clicking the `Fork` button in the top right corner.


## Deploy to LangGraph CloudÂ¶
1. Log in to LangSmith ![Login to LangSmith](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/deployment/img/01_login.png) Go to LangSmith and log in. If you don't have an account, you can sign up for free.  2. Click on _LangGraph Platform_ (the left sidebar) ![Login to LangSmith](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/deployment/img/02_langgraph_platform.png) Select **LangGraph Platform** from the left sidebar.  3. Click on + New Deployment (top right corner) ![Login to LangSmith](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/deployment/img/03_deployments_page.png) Click on **+ New Deployment** to create a new deployment. This button is located in the top right corner. It'll open a new modal where you can fill out the required fields.  4. Click on Import from GitHub (first time users) ![image](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/deployment/img/04_create_new_deployment.png) Click on **Import from GitHub** and follow the instructions to connect your GitHub account. This step is needed for **first-time users** or to add private repositories that haven't been connected before. 5. Select the repository, configure ENV vars etc ![image](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/deployment/img/05_configure_deployment.png) Select the **repository** , add env variables and secrets, and set other configuration options. 
  * **Repository** : Select the repository you forked earlier (or any other repository you want to deploy).
  * Set the secrets and environment variables required by your application. For the **ReAct Agent** template, you need to set the following secrets:
    * **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY** : Get an API key from Anthropic.
    * **TAVILY_API_KEY** : Get an API key on the Tavily website.

6. Click Submit to Deploy! ![image](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/deployment/img/05_configure_deployment.png) Please note that this step may ~15 minutes to complete. You can check the status of your deployment in the **Deployments** view. Click the **Submit** button at the top right corner to deploy your application. 
## LangGraph Studio Web UIÂ¶
Once your application is deployed, you can test it in **LangGraph Studio**. 
1. Click on an existing deployment ![image](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/deployment/img/07_deployments_page.png) Click on the deployment you just created to view more details.  2. Click on LangGraph Studio ![image](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/deployment/img/08_deployment_view.png) Click on the **LangGraph Studio** button to open LangGraph Studio.

## Test the APIÂ¶
Note
The API calls below are for the **ReAct Agent** template. If you're deploying a different application, you may need to adjust the API calls accordingly.
Before using, you need to get the `URL` of your LangGraph deployment. You can find this in the `Deployment` view. Click the `URL` to copy it to the clipboard.
You also need to make sure you have set up your API key properly, so you can authenticate with LangGraph Cloud.
```
exportLANGSMITH_API_KEY=...

```
