Frontend Independent
Bring your existing web stack to Tauri or start that new dream project. Tauri supports any frontend framework so you don’t need to change your stack.
Cross Platform
Build your app for Linux, macOS, Windows, Android and iOS - all from a single codebase.
Inter-Process Communication
Write your frontend in JavaScript, application logic in Rust, and integrate deep into the system with Swift and Kotlin.
Maximum Security
Front-of-mind for the Tauri Team that drives our highest priorities and biggest innovations.
Minimal Size
By using the OS’s native web renderer, the size of a Tauri app can be little as 600KB.
Powered by Rust
With performance and security at the center, Rust is the language for the next generation of apps.
