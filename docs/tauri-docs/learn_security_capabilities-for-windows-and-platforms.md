# Capabilities for Different Windows and Platforms
This guide will help you customize the capabilities of your Tauri app.
## Content of this guide
  * Create multiple windows in a Tauri app
  * Use different capabilities for different windows
  * Use platform-specific capabilities


## Prerequisites
This exercise is meant to be read after completing `Using Plugin Permissions`.
## Guide
  1. ### Create Multiple Windows in a Tauri Application
Here we create an app with two windows labelled `first` and `second`. There are multiple ways to create windows in your Tauri application.
#### Create Windows with the Tauri Configuration File
In the Tauri configuration file, usually named `tauri.conf.json`:
Show solution
```

"productName": "multiwindow",
...
"app": {
"windows": [
{
"label": "first",
"title": "First",
"width": 800,
"height": 600
},
{
"label": "second",
"title": "Second",
"width": 800,
"height": 600
}
],
},
...
}

```

#### Create Windows Programmatically
In the Rust code to create a Tauri app:
Show solution
```

tauri::Builder::default()
.invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![greet])
.setup(|app| {
letwebview_url= tauri::WebviewUrl::App("index.html".into());
// First window
tauri::WebviewWindowBuilder::new(app, "first", webview_url.clone())
.title("First")
.build()?;
// Second window
tauri::WebviewWindowBuilder::new(app, "second", webview_url)
.title("Second")
.build()?;
Ok(())
})
.run(context)
.expect("error while running tauri application");

```

  2. ### Apply Different Capabilities to Different Windows
The windows of a Tauri app can use different features or plugins of the Tauri backend. For better security it is recommended to only give the necessary capabilities to each window. We simulate a scenario where the `first` windows uses filesystem and dialog functionalities and `second` only needs dialog functionalities.
#### Separate capability files per category
It is recommended to separate the capability files per category of actions they enable.
Show solution
JSON files in the `src-tauri/capabilities` will be taken into account for the capability system. Here we separate capabilities related to the filesystem and dialog window into `filesystem.json` and `dialog.json`.
_filetree of the Tauri project:_
```

/src
/src-tauri
/capabilities
filesystem.json
dialog.json
tauri.conf.json
package.json
README.md

```

#### Give filesystem capabilities to the `first` window
We give the `first` window the capability to have read access to the content of the `$HOME` directory.
Show solution
Use the `windows` field in a capability file with one or multiple window labels.
filesystem.json```

{
"identifier": "fs-read-home",
"description": "Allow access file access to home directory",
"local": true,
"windows": ["first"],
"permissions": [
"fs:allow-home-read",
]
}

```

#### Give dialog capabilities to the `first` and `second` window
We give to `first` and `second` windows the capability to create a “Yes/No” dialog
Show solution
Use the `windows` field in a capability file with one or multiple window labels.
dialog.json```

{
"identifier": "dialog",
"description": "Allow to open a dialog",
"local": true,
"windows": ["first", "second"],
"permissions": ["dialog:allow-ask"]
}

```

  3. ### Make Capabilities Platform Dependent
We now want to customize the capabilities to be active only on certain platforms. We make our filesystem capabilities only active on `linux` and `windows`.
Show solution
Use the `platforms` field in a capability file to make it platform-specific.
filesystem.json```

{
"identifier": "fs-read-home",
"description": "Allow access file access to home directory",
"local": true,
"windows": ["first"],
"permissions": [
"fs:allow-home-read",
],
"platforms": ["linux", "windows"]
}

```

The currently available platforms are `linux`, `windows`, `macos`, `android`, and `ios`.


## Conclusion and Resources
We have learned how to create multiple windows in a Tauri app and give them specific capabilities. Furthermore these capabilities can also be targeted to certain platforms.
An example application that used window capabilities can be found in the `api` example of the Tauri Github repository. The fields that can be used in a capability file are listed in the Capability reference.
