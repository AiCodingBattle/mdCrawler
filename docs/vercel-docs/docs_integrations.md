# Vercel Integrations Overview
Learn how to extend Vercel's capabilities by integrating with your preferred providers for AI, databases, headless content, commerce, and more.
Table of Contents
Integrations allow you to extend the capabilities of Vercel by connecting with third-party platforms or services to do things like:
  * Work with storage products from third-party solutions
  * Connect with external AI services
  * Send logs to services
  * Integrate with testing tools
  * Connect your CMS and ecommerce platform


To extend and automate your workflow, the Vercel Marketplace page provides you with two types of integrations, depending on your needs:
  * Native integrations
  * Connectable accounts


## Connectable accounts
These integrations allow you to connect Vercel with an existing account on a third-party platform or service and provide you with features and environment variables that enable seamless integration with the third party.
When you add a connectable account integration through the Vercel dashboard, you are prompted to log in to your account on the third-party platform.
### Get started with connectable account integrations
  * Add a connectable account: As a Vercel customer, you can integrate with many of the other tools you require into your Vercel workflow
  * Integrate with Vercel: You can extend the Vercel platform through traditional integrations, guides, and templates that you can distribute privately, or host on the Vercel Marketplace


## Native integrations
Native integrations allow a two-way connection between Vercel and third-parties Vercel has partnered with. These native integrations provide the option to subscribe to products through the Vercel dashboard.
Native integrations provide the following benefits:
  * You don't have to create an account on the integration provider's site.
  * For each available product, you can choose the billing plan suitable for your needs through the Vercel dashboard.
  * The billing is managed through your Vercel account.


### Get started with native integrations
  * Extend your Vercel workflow: As as a Vercel customer, you can install an integration from the marketplace and subscribe to the product that fits your need.
  * Integrate with Vercel: As a Vercel provider, you can create an integration and make different products from your third-party service available for purchase to Vercel customers through the marketplace.
