# Security
Vercel provides built-in and customizable features to ensure that your site is secure.
Table of Contents
Cloud-deployed web applications face constant security threats, with attackers launching millions of malicious attacks weekly. Your application, users, and business require robust security measures to stay protected.
A comprehensive security strategy requires both active protection, robust policies, and compliance frameworks:
  * Security governance and policies ensure long-term organizational safety, maintain regulatory adherence, and establish consistent security practices across teams.
  * A Multi-layered protection system provides active security against immediate threats and attacks.


## Governance and policies
### Compliance measures
Learn about the protection and compliance measures Vercel takes to ensure the security of your data, including DDoS mitigation, SOC2 Type 2 compliance, Data encryption, and more.
### Shared responsibility model
A shared responsibility model is a framework designed to split tasks and obligations between two groups in cloud computing. The model divides duties to ensure security, maintenance, and service functionality.
### Encryption
Out of the box, every Deployment on Vercel is served over an HTTPS connection. The SSL certificates for these unique URLs are automatically generated free of charge.
## Multi-layered protection
Understand how Vercel protects every incoming request with multiple layers of firewall and deployment protection.
### Vercel firewall
The Vercel firewall helps to protect your applications and websites from malicious attacks and unauthorized access through:
  * An enterprise-grade platform-wide firewall available for free for all customers with no configuration required that includes automatic DDoS mitigation and protection against low quality traffic.
  * A Web Application Firewall (WAF) that supports custom rules, managed rulesets, and allows customers to challenge automated traffic. You can customize the WAF at the project level.
  * Observability into network traffic and firewall activity, including the access to firewall logs.


## Secure access
You can secure and restrict access to your deployments and connected resources with:
  * Secure Deployments
  * Secure Backend Access
