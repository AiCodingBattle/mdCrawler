# Projects overview
A project is the application that you have deployed to Vercel.
Table of Contents
Next.js (/app)
Projects on Vercel represent applications that you have deployed to the platform from a single Git repository. Each project can have multiple deployments: a single production deployment and many pre-production deployments. A project groups deployments and custom domains.
While each project is only connected to a single, imported Git repository, you can have multiple projects connected to a single Git repository that includes many directories, which is particularly useful for monorepo setups.
You can view all projects in your team's Vercel dashboard and selecting a project will bring you to the project dashboard, where you can:
  * View an overview of the production deployment and any active pre-production deployments.
  * Configure project settings such as setting custom domains, environment variables, deployment protection, and more.
  * View details about each deployment for that project, such as the status, the commit that triggered the deployment, the deployment URL, and more.
  * Manage observability for that project, including Web Analytics, Speed Insights, and Logs.
  * Managing the project's firewall.
