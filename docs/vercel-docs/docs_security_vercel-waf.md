Learn how to secure your website with the Vercel Web Application Firewall (WAF)

Vercel WAF is available on all plans
Those with the member, viewer, developer and administrator roles can access this feature
The Vercel WAF, part of the Firewall, provides security controls to monitor and control the internet traffic to your site through logging, blocking and challenging. When you apply a configuration change to the firewall, it takes effect globally within 300ms and can be instantly rolled back to prior configurations.
  * Configure your first Custom Rule
  * Add IP Blocks
  * Explore Managed Rulesets


## Traffic control
You can control the internet traffic to your website in the following ways:
  * IP blocking: Learn how to configure IP blocking
  * Custom rules: Learn how to configure custom rules for your project
  * Managed rulesets: Learn how to enable managed rulesets for your project (Enterprise plan)

You can quickly revert to a previous version of your firewall configuration. This can be useful in situations that require a quick recovery from unexpected behavior or rule creation.
To restore to a previous version:
  1. From your dashboard, select the project that you'd like to configure a rule for and then select the Firewall tab
  2. Select the View Audit Log option by clicking on the ellipsis menu at the top right
  3. Find the version that you would like to restore to by using the date and time selectors
  4. Select Restore and then Restore Configuration on the confirmation modal
