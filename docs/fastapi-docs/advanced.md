# Advanced User GuideÂ¶
## Additional FeaturesÂ¶
The main Tutorial - User Guide should be enough to give you a tour through all the main features of **FastAPI**.
In the next sections you will see other options, configurations, and additional features.
Tip
The next sections are **not necessarily "advanced"**.
And it's possible that for your use case, the solution is in one of them.
## Read the Tutorial firstÂ¶
You could still use most of the features in **FastAPI** with the knowledge from the main Tutorial - User Guide.
And the next sections assume you already read it, and assume that you know those main ideas.
## External CoursesÂ¶
Although the Tutorial - User Guide and this **Advanced User Guide** are written as a guided tutorial (like a book) and should be enough for you to **learn FastAPI** , you might want to complement it with additional courses.
Or it might be the case that you just prefer to take other courses because they adapt better to your learning style.
Some course providers âœ¨ **sponsor FastAPI** âœ¨, this ensures the continued and healthy **development** of FastAPI and its **ecosystem**.
And it shows their true commitment to FastAPI and its **community** (you), as they not only want to provide you a **good learning experience** but also want to make sure you have a **good and healthy framework** , FastAPI. ðŸ™‡
