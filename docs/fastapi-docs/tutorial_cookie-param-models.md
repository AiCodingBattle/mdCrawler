# Cookie Parameter Models¬∂
If you have a group of **cookies** that are related, you can create a **Pydantic model** to declare them. üç™
This would allow you to **re-use the model** in **multiple places** and also to declare validations and metadata for all the parameters at once. üòé
Note
This is supported since FastAPI version `0.115.0`. ü§ì
Tip
This same technique applies to `Query`, `Cookie`, and `Header`. üòé
## Cookies with a Pydantic Model¬∂
Declare the **cookie** parameters that you need in a **Pydantic model** , and then declare the parameter as `Cookie`:
Python 3.10+
```
fromtypingimport Annotated
fromfastapiimport Cookie, FastAPI
frompydanticimport BaseModel
app = FastAPI()
classCookies(BaseModel):
  session_id: str
  fatebook_tracker: str | None = None
  googall_tracker: str | None = None
@app.get("/items/")
async defread_items(cookies: Annotated[Cookies, Cookie()]):
  return cookies

```

ü§ì Other versions and variants
Python 3.9+Python 3.8+Python 3.10+ - non-AnnotatedPython 3.8+ - non-Annotated
```
fromtypingimport Annotated, Union
fromfastapiimport Cookie, FastAPI
frompydanticimport BaseModel
app = FastAPI()
classCookies(BaseModel):
  session_id: str
  fatebook_tracker: Union[str, None] = None
  googall_tracker: Union[str, None] = None
@app.get("/items/")
async defread_items(cookies: Annotated[Cookies, Cookie()]):
  return cookies

```

```
fromtypingimport Union
fromfastapiimport Cookie, FastAPI
frompydanticimport BaseModel
fromtyping_extensionsimport Annotated
app = FastAPI()
classCookies(BaseModel):
  session_id: str
  fatebook_tracker: Union[str, None] = None
  googall_tracker: Union[str, None] = None
@app.get("/items/")
async defread_items(cookies: Annotated[Cookies, Cookie()]):
  return cookies

```

Tip
Prefer to use the `Annotated` version if possible.
```
fromfastapiimport Cookie, FastAPI
frompydanticimport BaseModel
app = FastAPI()
classCookies(BaseModel):
  session_id: str
  fatebook_tracker: str | None = None
  googall_tracker: str | None = None
@app.get("/items/")
async defread_items(cookies: Cookies = Cookie()):
  return cookies

```

Tip
Prefer to use the `Annotated` version if possible.
```
fromtypingimport Union
fromfastapiimport Cookie, FastAPI
frompydanticimport BaseModel
app = FastAPI()
classCookies(BaseModel):
  session_id: str
  fatebook_tracker: Union[str, None] = None
  googall_tracker: Union[str, None] = None
@app.get("/items/")
async defread_items(cookies: Cookies = Cookie()):
  return cookies

```

**FastAPI** will **extract** the data for **each field** from the **cookies** received in the request and give you the Pydantic model you defined.
## Check the Docs¬∂
You can see the defined cookies in the docs UI at `/docs`:
![](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/tutorial/cookie-param-models/image01.png)
Info
Have in mind that, as **browsers handle cookies** in special ways and behind the scenes, they **don't** easily allow **JavaScript** to touch them.
If you go to the **API docs UI** at `/docs` you will be able to see the **documentation** for cookies for your _path operations_.
But even if you **fill the data** and click "Execute", because the docs UI works with **JavaScript** , the cookies won't be sent, and you will see an **error** message as if you didn't write any values.
## Forbid Extra Cookies¬∂
In some special use cases (probably not very common), you might want to **restrict** the cookies that you want to receive.
Your API now has the power to control its own cookie consent. ü§™üç™
You can use Pydantic's model configuration to `forbid` any `extra` fields:
Python 3.9+
```
fromtypingimport Annotated, Union
fromfastapiimport Cookie, FastAPI
frompydanticimport BaseModel
app = FastAPI()
classCookies(BaseModel):
  model_config = {"extra": "forbid"}
  session_id: str
  fatebook_tracker: Union[str, None] = None
  googall_tracker: Union[str, None] = None
@app.get("/items/")
async defread_items(cookies: Annotated[Cookies, Cookie()]):
  return cookies

```

ü§ì Other versions and variants
Python 3.10+Python 3.8+Python 3.10+ - non-AnnotatedPython 3.8+ - non-Annotated

fromtypingimport Annotated
fromfastapiimport Cookie, FastAPI
frompydanticimport BaseModel
app = FastAPI()
classCookies(BaseModel):
  model_config = {"extra": "forbid"}
  session_id: str
  fatebook_tracker: str | None = None
  googall_tracker: str | None = None
@app.get("/items/")
async defread_items(cookies: Annotated[Cookies, Cookie()]):
  return cookies

```

```
fromtypingimport Union
fromfastapiimport Cookie, FastAPI
frompydanticimport BaseModel
fromtyping_extensionsimport Annotated
app = FastAPI()
classCookies(BaseModel):
  model_config = {"extra": "forbid"}
  session_id: str
  fatebook_tracker: Union[str, None] = None
  googall_tracker: Union[str, None] = None
@app.get("/items/")
async defread_items(cookies: Annotated[Cookies, Cookie()]):
  return cookies

```

Tip
Prefer to use the `Annotated` version if possible.
```
fromfastapiimport Cookie, FastAPI
frompydanticimport BaseModel
app = FastAPI()
classCookies(BaseModel):
  model_config = {"extra": "forbid"}
  session_id: str
  fatebook_tracker: str | None = None
  googall_tracker: str | None = None
@app.get("/items/")
async defread_items(cookies: Cookies = Cookie()):
  return cookies

```

  googall_tracker: Union[str, None] = None
@app.get("/items/")
async defread_items(cookies: Cookies = Cookie()):
  return cookies

```

If a client tries to send some **extra cookies** , they will receive an **error** response.
Poor cookie banners with all their effort to get your consent for the API to reject it. üç™
For example, if the client tries to send a `santa_tracker` cookie with a value of `good-list-please`, the client will receive an **error** response telling them that the `santa_tracker` cookie is not allowed:
```
{
"detail":[
{
"type":"extra_forbidden",
"loc":["cookie","santa_tracker"],
"msg":"Extra inputs are not permitted",
"input":"good-list-please",
}
]
}

```

## Summary¬∂
You can use **Pydantic models** to declare **cookies** in **FastAPI**. üòé

  *[cookie consent]: This is a joke, just in case. It has nothing to do with cookie consents, but it's funny that even the API can now reject the poor cookies. Have a cookie. üç™
  *[API to reject it]: This is another joke. Don't pay attention to me. Have some coffee for your cookie. ‚òï
  *[cookie is not allowed]: Santa disapproves the lack of cookies. üéÖ Okay, no more cookie jokes.
  *[**cookies**]: Have a last cookie before you go. üç™
