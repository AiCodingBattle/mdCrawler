# NextUI to HeroUI
HeroUI is the new identity for NextUI, bringing the same powerful components and features you love under a new name. This guide will help you migrate your existing NextUI project to HeroUI.
## Automatic Migration (Recommended)
The easiest way to migrate your NextUI project to HeroUI is using our official codemod:
### Run Migration
Execute the codemod in your project directory:
npm
yarn
pnpm
bun
> **Note:** If you're using a monorepo, run the codemod from the root directory
This will automatically:
  * Update all package names from `@nextui-org/*` to `@heroui/*`
  * Rename component imports and references
  * Update TailwindCSS configuration
  * Transform provider components
  * Adjust any NextUI-specific utilities or hooks
  * Update `.npmrc` file pnpm only


### Install Dependencies
After running the codemod, install the new dependencies:
npm
yarn
pnpm
bun
## Manual Migration
If you prefer to migrate manually, follow these steps:
### Update Dependencies
Replace NextUI packages with their HeroUI equivalents:
npm
yarn
pnpm
bun
### Update TailwindCSS Configuration
Update your `tailwind.config.js`:
### Update Provider Component
Replace the NextUI provider with HeroUI's provider:
### Update Imports
Update all component imports to use the new package name:
### Individual Packages
If you're using individual packages, update each package name:
### Npmrc Pnpm Only
If you are using pnpm, you need to update your .npmrc file to use the new package name:
## Verification
After migration, verify that:
  1. All components render correctly
  2. Theme customizations are preserved
  3. No NextUI imports remain in your codebase
  4. Your application builds without errors


> The functionality and API of all components remain the same - only the package names and imports have changed.
## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues during migration, try these steps:
### NPM Users
If you're using `npm`, you may need to:
  1. Delete your `node_modules` folder
  2. Delete your `package-lock.json` file
  3. Reinstall all packages with `npm install`


### Package.json Check
Ensure that no `@nextui-org` packages remain in your `package.json` dependencies or devDependencies.
