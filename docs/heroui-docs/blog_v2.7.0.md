## Toast Component
The new Toast component provides a flexible and accessible way to show temporary notifications in your application. It comes with built-in support for different placements, variants, and animations. Inspired by Sonner, our Toast component brings a beautiful, minimal, and customizable notification system to HeroUI.
### Setup
First, add the `ToastProvider` to your application:
### Basic Usage
### Features
  * Multiple placement options (top, bottom, left, right, center)
  * Different variants (solid, bordered, flat)
  * Custom timeout duration
  * Progress indicator
  * Promise support for loading states
  * Customizable icons and styling
  * Accessibility built-in

## Theme Generator
The new Theme Generator is a powerful web-based tool that allows you to create and customize your themes visually. Based on the amazing work by xylish7 in the nextui-theme-generator project (huge thanks!), our Theme Generator provides a seamless experience for theme customization. Simply visit our Theme Generator to:
  * Create custom color schemes
  * Preview components with your theme in real-time
  * Generate the theme code automatically
  * Export your theme configuration
  * Test different color combinations
  * Ensure proper contrast and accessibility


This tool makes it easier than ever to maintain consistent design across your application without having to write theme configuration manually.
For more information about theming and customization, visit our Theme documentation.
## Table Virtualization
The Table component now supports virtualization, significantly improving performance when working with large datasets.

Code

## New Global Props
We've added new global configuration options to the `HeroUIProvider` that allow you to set default behaviors across your application:
#### Label Placement
You can now set a global default for label placement across all form-based components. This affects components that have the `labelPlacement` property, including:
  * Input
  * Select
  * Autocomplete
  * DatePicker
  * DateRangePicker
  * TimeInput
  * NumberInput
  * And more...


#### Spinner Variant
You can set a global default spinner variant that will be used by all components that show loading states, including:
  * Select
  * Autocomplete
  * Button
  * And other components that use loading indicators


You can combine multiple global props to maintain consistent behavior throughout your application:
For more information about global configuration options, visit our Provider documentation.
## Keyboard Support
Enhanced keyboard support with the addition of `fn`, `win`, and `alt` keys for better accessibility and user interaction.
## Type Improvements
Better TypeScript support with exported `PressEvent` type for `onPress` event handling:
## What's Next?
We're actively working on **Tailwind CSS v4** support! You can check out our progress at tv4.heroui.com. We'll be releasing a beta version soon (PR #4656).
We're building an exciting new application that will revolutionize frontend development with HeroUI, making your workflow smoother than ever. Stay tuned for updates! üî•
## Breaking Changes
  * Renamed `wrapper` slot to `tabWrapper` in Tabs component
  * Deprecated `dateInputClassNames` in favor of new styling approach. The existing styles can be moved to `classNames` instead.
  * Replaced directional terms `left` & `right` with `start` & `end` for better RTL support.
  * `ListboxItem`, `SelectItem` & AutocompleteItem no longer accept a `value` prop.
  * Spinner component is no longer a server component. If you are using global import, you need to add `use client` directive.
  * For those users using `@internationalized/date`, please bump to `3.7.0` to avoid incompatibility errors.
  * For those users using `@react-aria/i18n`, please bump to `3.12.5` to avoid incompatibility errors.
