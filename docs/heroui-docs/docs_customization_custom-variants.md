# Custom Variants
HeroUI allows you to create new variants for components by extending and customizing their styles. You can override the component's `variants`, `defaultVariants` and `compoundVariants`.
> **Note** : For one-off customizations, refer to the Override Styles documentation.
## Creating new variants for non-slots components
Let's use the Button component as an example. It's a non-slots component, and you can view its source styles here.
> **Note** : If you are not familiar with the variants concept, please refer to the Tailwind Variants documentation.
### Extend the original component variants
Use the `extendVariants` function to create a new component with customized variants based on an existing component.
### Use your custom component in your application
Then, you can now use your custom component in your application. Here, `MyButton` is used with the color set to `olive` and the size set to `xl`.
The new component will include the original props of the `Button` component, plus the new variants that you have created.

## Creating new variants for slots components
The `extendVariants` function can also be used with slot-based components like Input to add or override variants. You can view the Input component's source styles here.
> **Note** : If you are not familiar with the variants/slots concept, please refer to the Tailwind Variants documentation.
### Extend the original component variants
Use the `extendVariants` function to create a new component with custom variants based on the original component.
### Use your custom component in your application
Then, you can now use your custom component in your application. Here, `MyInput` is used with the color set to `slate` and the size set to `xl`.
The new component will include the original props of the Input component, plus the new variants that you have created.
> Use the `Styles source` link at the top of each component page to view its source code as a reference for customization.
