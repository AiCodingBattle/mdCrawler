# Table
Tables are used to display tabular data using rows and columns. They allow users to quickly scan, sort, compare, and take action on large amounts of data.
Storybook@heroui/tableSourceStyles source
## Installation
CLI
npm
yarn
pnpm
bun
> The above command is for individual installation only. You may skip this step if `@heroui/react` is already installed globally.
## Import
HeroUI exports 6 table-related components:
  * **Table** : The main component to display a table.
  * **TableHeader** : The header of the table.
  * **TableBody** : The body of the table.
  * **TableColumn** : The column of the table.
  * **TableRow** : The row of the table.
  * **TableCell** : The cell of the table.

## Usage
Preview
Code
### Dynamic
To render a table dynamically, you can use the `columns` prop to pass the columns and `items` prop to pass the data.
Preview
Code
#### Why not array map?
Using the `items` prop and providing a render function allows react-aria to automatically cache the results of rendering each item and avoid re-rendering all items in the collection when only one of them changes. This has big performance benefits for large collections.
You could also use `Array.map` to render the items, but it will not be as performant as using the `items` and `columns` prop.
Example:
> **Note** : To learn more about React Aria collections and how to use them, please check React Aria Collections.
### Empty State
You can use the `emptyContent` prop to render a custom component when the table is empty.
Preview
Code
### Without Header
In case you don't want to render the header, you can use the `hideHeader` prop.
Preview
Code
### Without Wrapper
By default the table is wrapped in a `div` element with a small shadow effect and a border radius. You can use the `removeWrapper` prop to remove the wrapper and only render the table.
Preview
Code
### Custom Cells
You can render any component inside the table cell. In the example below, we are rendering different components according to the `key` of the column.
Preview
Code
### Striped Rows
You can use the `isStriped` prop to render striped rows.
Preview
Code
### Single Row Selection
It is possible to make the table rows selectable. To do so, you can use the `selectionMode` prop. Use `defaultSelectedKeys` to provide a default set of selected rows.
Preview
Code
> **Note** : The value of the selected keys must match the key prop of the row.
### Multiple Row Selection
You can also select multiple rows by using the `selectionMode="multiple"` prop. Use `defaultSelectedKeys` to provide a default set of selected rows.
Preview
Code
> **Note** : When using multiple selection, selectable checkboxes will be rendered in the first column of the table.
### Disallow Empty Selection
Table also supports a `disallowEmptySelection` prop which forces the user to have at least one row in the Table selected at all times. In this mode, if a single row is selected and the user presses it, it will not be deselected.
Preview
Code
### Controlled Selection
To programmatically control row selection, use the `selectedKeys` prop paired with the `onSelectionChange` callback. The key prop from the selected rows will be passed into the callback when the row is pressed, allowing you to update state accordingly.
Preview
Code
> **Note** : The `selectedKeys` property must be a `Set` object.
### Disabled Rows
You can disable rows by using the `disabledKeys` prop. This will prevent rows from being selectable as shown in the example below.
Preview
Code
### Selection Behavior
By default, Table uses the `toggle` selection behavior, which behaves like a checkbox group: clicking, tapping, or pressing the `Space` or `Enter` keys toggles selection for the focused row.
When the `selectionBehavior` prop is set to `replace`, clicking a row with the mouse replaces the selection with only that row. Using the arrow keys moves both focus and selection. To select multiple rows, modifier keys such as `Ctrl`, `Cmd`, and `Shift` can be used.
Preview
Code
### Rows Actions
Table supports rows via the `onRowAction` callback. In the default `toggle` selection behavior, when nothing is selected, clicking or tapping the row triggers the row action.
This behavior is slightly different in the `replace` selection behavior, where single clicking selects the row and actions are performed via double click.
Preview
Code
### Sorting Rows
Table supports sorting its data when a column header is pressed. To designate that a `Column` should support sorting, provide it with the `allowsSorting` prop.
Table accepts a `sortDescriptor` prop that defines the current column key to sort by and the sort direction (ascending/descending). When the user presses a sortable column header, the column's key and sort direction is passed into the `onSortChange` callback, allowing you to update the `sortDescriptor` appropriately.
We recommend using the `useAsyncList` hook from @react-stately/data to manage the data sorting. So make sure to install it before using the sorting feature.
npm
yarn
pnpm
bun
Preview
Code
> Note that we passed the `isLoading` and `loadingContent` props to `TableBody` to render a loading state while the data is being fetched.
### Loading more data
Table allows you to add a custom component at the end of the table, on the example below we are using a button to load more data.
Preview
Code
> **Note** : We passed the `isHeaderSticky` to the `Table` component to make the header sticky.
### Paginated Table
You can use the Pagination component to paginate the table.
Preview
Code
### Async Pagination
It is also possible to use the Pagination component to paginate the table asynchronously. To fetch the data, we are using the `useSWR` hook from SWR.
Preview
Code
### Infinite Pagination
Table also supports infinite pagination. To do so, you can use the `useAsyncList` hook from @react-stately/data and @heroui/use-infinite-scroll hook.
npm
yarn
pnpm
bun
Preview
Code
### Virtualization
Table supports virtualization, which allows efficient rendering of large lists by only rendering items that are visible in the viewport. You can enable virtualization by setting the `isVirtualized` prop to `true`.
Preview
Code
> **Note** : The virtualization strategy is based on the @tanstack/react-virtual package, which provides efficient rendering of large lists by only rendering items that are visible in the viewport.
#### Ten Thousand Items
Here's an example of using virtualization with 10,000 items.
Preview
Code
#### Max Table Height
The `maxTableHeight` prop is used to set the maximum height of the table. This is required when using virtualization. By default, it's set to `600`.
Preview
Code
#### Custom Row Height
The `rowHeight` prop is used to set the height of each row in the table. This is required when using virtualization. By default, it's set to `40`.
Preview
Code
### Use Case Example
When creating a table, you usually need core functionalities like sorting, pagination, and filtering. In the example below, we combined all these functionalities to create a complete table.
Preview
Code
## Slots
  * **base** : Defines a flexible column layout and relative positioning for the table component.
  * **wrapper** : Applies to the outermost wrapper, providing padding, flexible layout, relative positioning, visual styles, and scrollable overflow handling.
  * **table** : Sets the table to have a full minimum width and auto-adjusting height.
  * **thead** : Specifies rounded corners for the first child row in the table header.
  * **tbody** : No specific styles are applied to the body of the table.
  * **tr** : Styles for table rows including group focus, outline properties, and a set of undefined focus-visible classes.
  * **th** : Styles for table headers, including padding, text alignment, font properties, and special styles for sortable columns.
  * **td** : Applies to table cells, with properties for padding, alignment, and relative positioning, plus special styles for first child elements, selection indication, and disabled cells.
  * **tfoot** : No specific styles are applied to the footer of the table.
  * **sortIcon** : Styles for sorting icons, with properties for margin, opacity, and transition effects based on sorting direction and hover state.
  * **emptyWrapper** : Defines style for an empty table, with text alignment, color, and a specified height.
  * **loadingWrapper** : Style applied when the table is loading, positioning it centrally in its container.


### Custom Styles
You can customize the `Table` component by passing custom Tailwind CSS classes to the component slots.
Preview
Code
## Data Attributes
`TableBody` has the following attributes:
  * **data-empty** : When the table is empty.
  * **data-loading** : When the table data is loading. Based on `TableBody` `isLoading` and `loadingContent` props.


`TableRow` has the following attributes:
  * **data-selected** : When the row is selected. Based on `Table` `selectedKeys` prop.
  * **data-disabled** : When the row is disabled. Based on `Table` `disabledKeys` prop.
  * **data-hover** : When the row is being hovered. Based on useHover
  * **data-focus-visible** : When the row is being focused with the keyboard. Based on useFocusRing.
  * **data-first** : When the row is the first row.
  * **data-middle** : When the row is in the middle.
  * **data-odd** : When the row is odd.
  * **data-last** : When the row is the last row.


`TableCell` has the following attributes:
