Storybook@heroui/modalReact AriaSourceStyles source
## Installation
CLI
npm
yarn
pnpm
bun
```

```

npx heroui-cli@latest add modal

```


```

> The above command is for individual installation only. You may skip this step if `@heroui/react` is already installed globally.
## Import
HeroUI exports 5 modal-related components:
  * **Modal** : The main component to display a modal.
  * **ModalContent** : The wrapper of the other modal components.
  * **ModalHeader** : The header of the modal.
  * **ModalBody** : The body of the modal.
  * **ModalFooter** : The footer of the modal.


Individual
Global
## Usage
When the modal opens:
  * Focus is bounded within the modal and set to the first tabbable element.
  * Content behind the modal dialog is inert, meaning that users cannot interact with it.

Code
### Non-dismissible
By default, the modal can be closed by clicking on the overlay or pressing the `Esc` key. You can disable this behavior by setting the following properties:
  * Set the `isDismissable` property to `false` to prevent the modal from closing when clicking on the overlay.
  * Set the `isKeyboardDismissDisabled` property to `true` to prevent the modal from closing when pressing the `Esc` key.


Preview
Code
### Modal placement
By default the modal is centered on screens larger than `sm` and is at the `bottom` of the screen on mobile. This placement is called `auto`, but you can change it by using the `placement` prop.
Preview
Code
> **Note** : The `top-center` and `bottom-center` positions mean that the modal is positioned at the top / bottom of the screen on mobile, and at the center of the screen on desktop.
### Overflow scroll
You can use the `scrollBehavior` prop to set the scroll behavior of the modal.
  * **inside** : The modal content will be scrollable.
  * **outside** : The modal content will be scrollable and the modal will be fixed.


Preview
Code
### With Form
The `Modal` handles the focus within the modal content. It means that you can use the modal with form elements without any problem. The focus returns to the trigger when the modal closes.
Preview
Code
> **Note** : You can add the `autoFocus` prop to the first `Input` component to focus it when the modal opens.
### Backdrop
The `Modal` component has a `backdrop` prop to show a backdrop behind the modal. The backdrop can be either `transparent`, `opaque` or `blur`. The default value is `opaque`.
Preview
Code
### Custom Backdrop
You can customize the backdrop by using the `backdrop` slot.
Preview
Code
### Custom Motion
Modal offers a `motionProps` property to customize the `enter` / `exit` animation.
Preview
Code
> Learn more about Framer motion variants here.
### Draggable
Try to drag the modal by clicking on the modal header and dragging.
Preview
Code
### Draggable Overflow
Setting overflow to `true` allows users to drag the modal to a position where it overflows the viewport.
Preview
Code
## Slots
  * **wrapper** : The wrapper slot of the modal. It wraps the `base` and the `backdrop` slots.
  * **base** : The main slot of the modal content.
  * **backdrop** : The backdrop slot, it is displayed behind the modal.
  * **header** : The header of the modal, it is displayed at the top of the modal.
  * **body** : The body of the modal, it is displayed in the middle of the modal.
  * **footer** : The footer of the modal, it is displayed at the bottom of the modal.
  * **closeButton** : The close button of the modal.


### Custom Styles
You can customize the `Modal` component by passing custom Tailwind CSS classes to the component slots.
Preview
Code
## Data Attributes
`Modal` has the following attributes on the `base` element:
  * **data-open** : When the modal is open. Based on modal state.
  * **data-dismissable** : When the modal is dismissable. Based on `isDismissable` prop.


## Accessibility
  * Content outside the modal is hidden from assistive technologies while it is open.
  * The modal optionally closes when interacting outside, or pressing the `Esc` key.
  * Focus is moved into the modal on mount, and restored to the trigger element on unmount.
  * While open, focus is contained within the modal, preventing the user from tabbing outside.
  * Scrolling the page behind the modal is prevented while it is open, including in mobile browsers.
