# Select
A select displays a collapsible list of options and allows a user to select one or more of them.
Storybook@heroui/selectReact AriaSourceStyles source
## Installation
CLI
npm
yarn
pnpm
bun
> The above command is for individual installation only. You may skip this step if `@heroui/react` is already installed globally.
## Import
HeroUI exports 3 select-related components:
  * **Select** : The main component, which is a wrapper for the other components.
  * **SelectSection** : The component that contains a group of select items.
  * **SelectItem** : The component that represents a select item.

## Usage
Preview
Code
### Dynamic items
Select follows the Collection Components API, accepting both static and dynamic collections.
  * **Static** : The usage example above shows the static implementation, which can be used when the full list of options is known ahead of time.
  * **Dynamic** : The example below can be used when the options come from an external data source such as an API call, or update over time.


Preview
Code
### Multiple Selection
You can use the `selectionMode="multiple"` property to allow multiple selection.
Preview
Code
### Disabled
Preview
Code
### Disabled Items
You can disable specific items by using the `disabledKeys` property.
Preview
Code
### Required
If you pass the `isRequired` property to the select, it will have a `danger` asterisk at the end of the label and the select will be required.

Code

### Radius
Preview
Code
### Label Placements
You can change the position of the label by setting the `labelPlacement` property to `inside`, `outside` or `outside-left`.
Preview
Code
> **Note** : If the `label` is not passed, the `labelPlacement` property will be `outside` by default.
### Start Content
You can use the `startContent` and `endContent` properties to add content to the start and end of the select.
Preview
Code
### Item Start & End Content
Since the `Select` component uses the Listbox component under the hood, you can use the `startContent` and `endContent` properties of the `SelectItem` component to add content to the start and end of the select item.
Preview
Code
### Custom Selector Icon
By default the select uses a `chevron-down` icon as the selector icon which rotates when the select is open. You can customize this icon by passing a custom one to the `selectorIcon` property.
Preview
Code
> **Note** : Use the `disableSelectorIconRotation` property to disable the rotation of the icon.
### Without Scroll Shadow
Select component uses the ScrollShadow under the hood to show a shadow when the select content is scrollable. You can disable this shadow by passing using the `scrollShadowProps` property.
Preview
Code
> **Note** : You can also use the `showScrollIndicators` property to disable the scroll indicators.
### With Description
You can add a description to the select by passing the `description` property.
Preview
Code
### With Error Message
You can combine the `isInvalid` and `errorMessage` properties to show an invalid select.
Preview
Code
### Controlled
You can use the `selectedKeys` and `onSelectionChange` / `onChange` properties to control the select value.
Using `onSelectionChange`:
Preview
Code
Using `onChange`:
Preview
Code
### Controlling the open state
You can control the open state of the select by using the `isOpen` and `onOpenChange` / `onClose` properties.
Preview
Code
### Custom Items
You can customize the select items by modifying the `SelectItem` children.
Preview
Code
### Custom Render Value
By default the select will render the selected item's text value, but you can customize this by passing a `renderValue` function.
Preview
Code
The `renderValue` function receives the selected items as a parameter and must return a `ReactNode`. Check the Render Value Function section for more details.
### Asynchronous Loading
Select supports asynchronous loading, in the example below we are using a custom hook to fetch the Pokemon API data in combination with the `useInfiniteScroll` hook to load more data when the user reaches the end of the list.
The `isLoading` prop is used to show a loading indicator instead of the selector icon when the data is being fetched.
npm
yarn
pnpm
Preview
Code
### Virtualization
Select supports virtualization, which allows efficient rendering of large lists by only rendering items that are visible in the viewport. You can enable virtualization by setting the `isVirtualized` prop to `true`.
Preview
Code
> **Note** : The virtualization strategy is based on the @tanstack/react-virtual package, which provides efficient rendering of large lists by only rendering items that are visible in the viewport.
#### Ten Thousand Items
Here's an example of using virtualization with 10,000 items.
Preview
Code
#### Max Listbox Height
The `maxListboxHeight` prop is used to set the maximum height of the listbox. This is required when using virtualization. By default, it's set to `256`.
Preview
Code
#### Custom Item Height
The `itemHeight` prop is used to set the height of each item in the listbox. This is required when using virtualization. By default, it's set to `32`.
> **Note** : If the height of the list items differs from the default due to `startContent` or other custom content, be sure to pass the correct value to `itemHeight` to prevent layout issues.
Preview
Code
### With Sections
You can use the `SelectSection` component to group select items.
Preview
Code
### Custom Sections Style
You can customize the sections style by using the `classNames` property of the `SelectSection` component.
Preview
Code
### Multiple Select Controlled
You can use the same properties as the single select to control the multiple select, `selectedKeys` and `onSelectionChange` / `onChange`.
Using `onSelectionChange`:
Preview
Code
Using `onChange`:
Preview
Code
### Multiple With Chips
You can render any component as the select value by using the `renderValue` property. In this example we are using the Chip component to render the selected items.
Preview
Code
> **Note** : Make sure to pass the `isMultiline` property to the `Select` component to allow the chips to wrap.
The `renderValue` function receives the selected items as a parameter and must return a `ReactNode`. Check the Render Value Function section for more details.
### Customizing the select
You can customize any slot of the select by using the `classNames` property. Select component also provides the popoverProps and listboxProps properties to customize the popover and listbox components.
Preview
Code
### Using `value` attribute in option
The `value` attribute is not directly supported in `SelectItem`. Instead, the `key` property should be used to set the `value` to be submitted in forms.
If you need to submit a specific `value` instead of the `key` during form submission, consider implementing a lookup map in your application.
## Slots
  * **base** : The main wrapper of the select. This wraps the rest of the slots.
  * **label** : The label of the select.
  * **mainWrapper** : Wraps the `helperWrapper` and the `trigger` slots.
  * **trigger** : The trigger of the select. This wraps the label the inner wrapper and the selector icon.
  * **innerWrapper** : The wrapper of the select content. This wraps the start/end content and the select value.
  * **selectorIcon** : The selector icon of the select. This is the icon that rotates when the select is open (`data-open`).
  * **value** : The select value. This is also the slot that wraps the `renderValue` function result.
  * **listboxWrapper** : The wrapper of the listbox. This wraps the listbox component, this slot is used on top of the scroll shadow component.
  * **listbox** : The listbox component. This is the component that wraps the select items.
  * **popoverContent** : The popover content slot. Use this to modify the popover content styles.
  * **helperWrapper** : The wrapper of the helper text. This wraps the helper text and the error message.
  * **description** : The description of the select.
  * **errorMessage** : The error message of the select.
