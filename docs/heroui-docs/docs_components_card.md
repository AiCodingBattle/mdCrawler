Preview
Code
### Blurred Card
You can pass the `isBlurred` prop to the card to blur the card. Card gets blurred properties based on its ancestor element.
> **Note** : To achieve the blur effect as seen in the preview, you need to provide a suitable background (e.g., `bg-gradient-to-tr from-[#FFB457] to-[#FF705B]`) to an ancestor element of the Card component allowing the Card's blur effect to be visible.
Preview
Code
### Primary Action
If you pass the `isPressable` prop to the card, it will be rendered as a button.
Preview
Code
> **Note** : that the used callback function is `onPress` instead of `onClick`. Please see the usePress component for more details.
### Cover Image
You can use `Image` component as the cover of the card by taking it out of the `CardBody` component.

Code
