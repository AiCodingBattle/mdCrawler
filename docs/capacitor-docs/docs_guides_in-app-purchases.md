Most apps need to create and consume In App Purchases in order to generate revenue and enable upgrades. Adding In App Purchase support to your Capacitor app is straightforward, but requires a fair amount of work configuring and registering your own app products.

```
npminstall cordova-plugin-purchasenpx cap update
```
