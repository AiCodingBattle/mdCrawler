Key Components
## Role & Goal
Defines the agentâ€™s purpose and objectives through role definition and specific goals
## Capabilities
Tools and functions available to the agent for task execution
## Memory
Context retention and learning capabilities across interactions
## Language Model
The underlying AI model powering the agentâ€™s intelligence

Role and Goal
Clear role and goal definitions are crucial for optimal agent performance.
Component| Description| Example  
---|---|---  
**Role**|  Agentâ€™s function and expertise| Research Analyst, Code Developer  
**Goal**|  Specific objectives to achieve| Analyze market trends, Generate reports  
**Backstory**|  Contextual background| Expert with 10 years of experience  
### 
â€‹
Capabilities
Basic
Copy
```
agent = Agent(
  name="Researcher",
  role="Senior Research Analyst",
  goal="Uncover cutting-edge developments in AI",
  backstory="You are an expert at a technology research group",
  verbose=True,
  llm="gpt-4o",
  markdown=True
)

```

1
Install PraisonAI
Install the core package:
Terminal
Copy
```
pip install praisonaiagents

```

2
Configure Environment
Terminal
Copy
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key

```

Generate your OpenAI API key from OpenAI Use other LLM providers like Ollama, Anthropic, Groq, Google, etc. Please refer to the Models for more information.
3
Create Agent
Create `app.py`:
Single Agent
Multi Agents
Copy
```
from praisonaiagents import Agent
agent = Agent(instructions="Your are a helpful AI assistant")
agent.start("Write a movie script about a robot in Mars")

```

4
Start Agents
Execute your script:
Terminal
Copy
```
python app.py

```

You should see:
  * Agent initialization
  * Agents progress
  * Final results
  * Generated report

Define clear, specific roles for each agent
2
Goal Setting
Set specific, measurable goals
3
Tool Selection
Choose relevant tools for the task
4
Memory Setup
Configure appropriate memory settings
## Agent Interaction
1
Communication
Establish clear communication protocols
2
Delegation
Define explicit delegation rules
3
Error Handling
Implement robust error handling
4
Resource Management
Set up efficient resource allocation
##

  * Integration


Copy
```
async def main():
  agent = Agent(name="AsyncAgent")
  result = await agent.aprocess_task()

```

  * Full async/await support
  * Non-blocking operations
  * Enhanced performance


## 
â€‹

Async Support
Agents now support asynchronous operations through the following methods:
  * `achat`: Async version of the chat method
  * `astart`: Async version of start method
  * `aexecute_task`: Async version of execute_task method
  * `arun_task`: Async version of run_task method
  * `arun_all_tasks`: Async version of run_all_tasks method


### 
â€‹
Example Usage:
Copy
```
import asyncio
from praisonaiagents import Agent, Task, PraisonAIAgents
async def main():
  # Create an async agent
  async_agent = Agent(
    name="AsyncAgent",
    role="Async Task Specialist",
    goal="Perform async operations",
    backstory="Expert in async operations",
    tools=[async_search_tool], # Your async tool
    verbose=True
  )
  # Create an async task
  async_task = Task(
    description="Perform async operation",
    expected_output="Async result",
    agent=async_agent,
    async_execution=True # Enable async execution
  )
  # Create and start agents with async support
  agents = PraisonAIAgents(
    agents=[async_agent],
    tasks=[async_task],
    verbose=True
  )
  
  # Start async execution
  result = await agents.astart()
  print(result)
# Run the async main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
  asyncio.run(main())

```

### 
â€‹
Key Features:
  * Full async/await support
  * Parallel task execution
  * Async tool integration
