## 📄️ Mouse and Touch
Excalibur handles mouse and touch input by abstracting event handling into a [Engine.input|engine.input.pointers]] API that closely follows the [W3C Pointer Events spec. Excalibur normalizes both mouse and touch events to a single [[Input.PointerEvent|PointerEvent]]
## 📄️ Gamepads and Controllers
You can query any [[Input.Gamepad|Gamepads]] that are connected or listen to events ("button" and "axis").
