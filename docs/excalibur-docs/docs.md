## What is Excalibur?​
Excalibur is a **freeopen source 2D game engine** written in **TypeScript** for making 2D games for the web.
Our goal is to make it easier for you to create 2D HTML/JS games, whether you're new to game development or you're an experienced game developer. We take care of all of the boilerplate engine code, cross-platform targeting, and more! Use as much or as little as you need!
