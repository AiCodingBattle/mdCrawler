Excalibur uses a theater-style metaphor to organize your games. There are `Actor`'s which can move around and do things in the currently active `Scene`. All of that lives in the `Engine` container.
The fastest way to get an Excalibur project up and running is using the npm CLI tool. All of the included templates are open source on our github
```

sh
npx create-excalibur@latest
Copy
```
```

sh
npx create-excalibur@latest
