## 📄️ Coroutines
New ex.coroutine for running code that changes over time, useful for modeling complex animation code. It can do a lot of what the Actions API can do, but this is useful when things really get complicated.
## 📄️ Patterns
Here are a few patterns and guidelines that you can use in your Excalibur projects.
## 📄️ Timers
Timers are useful for running tasks synchronized with the Excalibur update and framerate, using the browser setTimeout() or setInterval().
## 📄️ Triggers
[[Trigger|Triggers]] can be used to fire logic when an [[Actor]] intersects with a [[Collider]], this is useful for in game switches, doors, or other in game sensors.
## 📄️ Clock
The Excalibur mainloop, the infinite update and draw cycle, is driven by the [[Clock]].
## 📄️ PostProcessors
[[PostProcessor|PostProcessors]] are a way to quickly modify every pixel on the screen with WebGL fragment shaders. This can be useful to give your game a certain aesthetic or effect.
## 📄️ UI
HTML5 is super great at building UI's, there are many popular front end frameworks and toolkits that will deliver highly polished UIs, so we recommend that first.
## 📄️ Particles
Particles can be used to generate dust, smoke, or fire effects in your games.
## 📄️ Performance
Excalibur uses the WebGL under the hood to render it's graphics, however sometimes browsers and systems may have a non standard configuration that can cause issues with WebGL.
