The WebView and the Capacitor runtime communicate through the use of **Capacitor Plugins**. Plugins provide access to native APIs such as camera, geolocation, and filesystem access in your web app.
## Capacitor Plugins​
The Capacitor team maintains a set of Capacitor plugins for commonly used APIs. There is also a large set of Capacitor plugins available from the Capacitor Community. If you have a suggestion for a Capacitor plugin, you can use the Capacitor Community proposals repo.

## Cordova Plugins​
Can't find the exact Web API or Capacitor plugin for your project? Or maybe you're migrating off of Cordova and onto Capacitor? Capacitor has a Cordova compatibility layer that attempts to mimic Cordova plugin functionality. Capacitor has compatibility with most Cordova plugins, but there may be additional steps when installing them.
