## Introducing Fluid compute
While dedicated servers provide efficiency and always-on availability, they often lead to over-provisioning, scaling challenges, and operational overhead. Serverless computing improves this with auto-scaling and pay-as-you-go pricing, but can suffer from cold starts and inefficient use of idle time. It’s time for a new, balanced approach. Fluid compute evolves beyond serverless, trading single-invocation functions for high-performance mini-servers. This model has helped thousands of early adopters maximize resource efficiency, minimize cold starts, and reduce compute costs by up to 85%.

## The rise of the AI crawler
AI crawlers have become a significant presence on the web. OpenAI's GPTBot generated 569 million requests across Vercel's network in the past month, while Anthropic's Claude followed with 370 million. For perspective, this combined volume represents about 20% of Googlebot's 4.5 billion requests during the same period. After analyzing how Googlebot handles JavaScript rendering with MERJ, we turned our attention to these AI assistants. Our new data reveals how Open AI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and other AI tools crawl and process web content. We uncovered clear patterns in how these crawlers handle JavaScript, prioritize content types, and navigate the web, which directly impact how AI tools understand and interact with modern web applications.

## Life of a Vercel request: What happens when a user presses enter
When developers push code, Vercel’s framework-defined infrastructure analyzes the codebase and intelligently provisions cloud resources. When requests come in, Vercel’s infrastructure instantly routes them to the nearest data center over a high-speed, low-latency network, delivering a response right back to the user. Vercel handles all of this behind the scenes. But understanding how your framework code powers the infrastructure—from deployment to request handling—gives you insight into how Vercel’s components work together, and enables you to further optimize user experiences. ﻿Here’s how Vercel manages requests at every stage.

## ISR on Vercel is now faster and more cost-efficient
When Next.js introduced Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) in 2020, it changed how developers build for the web. ISR combines the speed of static generation with the flexibility of dynamic rendering, enabling sites to update content without requiring full rebuilds. Vercel has supported ISR from day one, making it easy for teams at The Washington Post, Algolia, and Sonos to serve fresh content while keeping page loads fast.

## Working with Figma and custom design systems in v0
v0’s ability to import existing Figma files allows designers and developers to bridge the gap between design tools and AI-driven development. This feature extracts context from Figma files, along with any supplementary visuals, and passes them into v0's generation process.

## Mitigating Denial of Wallet risks with Vercel
Unlike traditional cyberattacks that target code or infrastructure vulnerabilities, Denial of Wallet (DoW) attacks focus on draining a service's operational budget. At Vercel, we're building controls and anomaly detection to help you defend against these threats and protect your applications.

## Headless Salesforce: An incremental migration from monolith to composable
For ecommerce teams running Salesforce Commerce Cloud, the platform's monolithic design can feel like a double-edged sword. While its out-of-the-box capabilities promise rapid deployments, they often hinder frontend flexibility and innovation. But what if you could unlock a new level of performance—without risking your core business? That’s exactly what a global sportswear brand achieved. Their headless Salesforce migration strategy halved their load times, cut cart abandonment by 28%, and increased mobile conversion rates by 15%. All without a disruptive, big-bang migration. Here’s how they did it and how you can too.

## Building the Black Friday-Cyber Monday live dashboard
This year, we built a Black Friday-Cyber Monday (BFCM) dashboard to celebrate the success of our customers through the busy retail weekend. The dashboard gave a real-time look inside Vercel's infrastructure, showing live metrics for deployments, requests, blocked traffic, and more. Building a data-heavy, real-time dashboard with a good user experience comes with challenges. Let's walk through how we overcame them.

## Optimizing secure builds with Hive and Secure Compute
In our previous blog post, we introduced Hive as Vercel’s low-level compute platform, powering all of our builds. However, some builds come with unique security requirements. For these, Hive integrates seamlessly with Vercel's Secure Compute, which enables teams to securely connect with their backends through private connections without compromising performance. Since moving Secure Compute to Hive, provisioning times have dropped from 90 seconds to 5 seconds and build performance has improved by an average of 30%, delivering both speed and reliability for even the most sensitive workloads.
