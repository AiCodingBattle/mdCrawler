# Runtime Logs
Learn how to search, inspect, and share your runtime logs with the Logs tab.
Table of Contents
Runtime Logs are available on all plans
Those with the owner, member, developer role can access this feature
The Logs tab allows you to view, search, inspect, and share your runtime logs without any third-party integration. You can also filter and group your runtime logs based on the relevant fields.
You can only view runtime logs from the Logs tab.  Build logs  can be accessed from the production deployment tile.
## What are runtime logs?
Runtime logs include all logs generated by Serverless and Edge Function invocations in both preview and production deployments. These log results provide information about the output for your functions as well as the `console.log` output.
With runtime logs:
  * Logs are shown in realtime and grouped as per request.
  * Each action of writing to standard output, such as using `console.log`, results in a separate log entry.
  * The maximum number of logs is 256 lines _per request_
  * Each of those logs can be up to 256 KB _per line_
  * The sum of all log lines can be up to 1 MB _per request_


## Available Log Types
You can view the following log types in the Logs tab:
Log Type| Available in Runtime Logs  
---|---  
Serverless Function Invocation| Yes  
Edge Function Invocation| Yes  
Edge Middleware Invocation| Yes  
Static Request| Only static request that serves cache; to get all static logs check Log Drains  
## View runtime logs
To view runtime logs:
  1. From the dashboard, select the project that you wish to see the logs for
  2. Select the Logs tab from your project overview
  3. From here you can view, filter, and search through the runtime logs. Each log row shares basic info about the request, like execution, domain name, HTTP status, function type, and RequestId.

## Log filters
You can use the following filters from the left sidebar to get a refined search experience.
### Timeline
You can filter runtime logs based on a specific timeline. It can vary from the past hour, last 3 days, or a custom timespan depending on your account type. You can use the Live mode option to follow the logs in real-time.

All displayed dates and times are in UTC.
### Level
You can filter requests that contain Warning, and Error logs. A request can contain both types of logs at the same time. Streaming functions will always preserve the original intent:
Source| Streaming functions| Non-streaming Functions  
---|---|---  
`stdout` (e.g. `console.log`)| `info`| `info`  
`stderr` (e.g. `console.error`)| `error`| `error`  
`console.warn`| `warning`| `error`  
Additionally:
  * Requests with a status code of `4xx` are marked with Warning amber
  * Requests with a status code of `5xx` are marked with Error red
  * All other individual log lines are considered Info


### Function
You can filter and analyze logs for one or more functions defined in your project. The log output is generated for the Serverless Functions, Edge Functions, and Edge Middleware.
### Host
You can view logs for one or more domains and subdomains attached to your team’s project. Alternatively, you can use the Search hosts... field to navigate to the desired host.
### Deployment
Like host and functions, you can filter your logs based on deployments URLs.
### Resource
Using the resource filter, you can search for requests containing logs generated as a result of:
Resource| Description  
---|---  
Serverless Functions| Logs generated from your Serverless Functions invocations. Log details include additional runtime Request Id details and other basic info  
Edge Middleware| Logs generated as a result of your Edge Middleware invocations  
Edge Functions| Logs requests generated from your Edge Functions. Log info includes time, domain, and the request method  
Edge Cache| Logs generated from proxy serving cache  
### Request Type
You can filter your logs based on framework-defined mechanism or rendering strategy used such as API routes, Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), and cron jobs.
### Request Method
You can filter your logs based on the request method used by a function such as `GET` or `POST`.
### Request Path
You can filter your logs based on the request path used by a function such as `/api/my-function`.
### Cache
You can filter your logs based on the cache behavior such as `HIT` or `MISS`.
### Logs from your browser
You can filter logs to only show requests made from your current browser by clicking the user button. This is helpful for debugging your own requests, especially when there's high traffic volume. The filter works by matching your IP address and User Agent against incoming requests.
The matching is based on your IP address and User Agent. In some cases, this data may not be accurate, especially if you're using a VPN or proxy, or if other people in your network are using the same IP address and browser.
## Search log fields
You can use the main search field to filter logs by their messages. In the current search state, filtered log results are sorted chronologically, with the most recent first. Filtered values can also be searched from the main search bar.
Value| Description  
---|---  
Function| The function name  
RequestPath| The request path name  
RequestType| The request rendering type. For example API endpoints or Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)  
Level| The level type. Can be Info, Warning, or Error  
Resource| Can be Edge Cache, Serverless Function, Edge Middleware, and Edge Function  
Host| Name of the domain or subdomain for which the log was generated  
Deployment| The name of your deployment  
Method| The request method used. For example `GET`, `POST` etc.  
Cache| Cache status with the values `HIT`, `MISS`, `STALE`, `BYPASS`, `PRERENDER` or `REVALIDATED`  
Status| HTTP status code for the log message  
RequestID| Unique identifier of request. This is visible on a 404 page, for example.  
This **free text search** feature is limited to the `message` and `requestPath` field. Other fields can be filtered using the left sidebar or the filters in the search bar.
## Log details
You can view details for each request to analyze and improve your debugging experience. When you click a log from the list, the following details appear in the right sidebar:
Info| Description  
---|---  
Request Path| Request path of the log  
Time| Timestamp at which the log was recorded in UTC  
Status Code| HTTP status code for the log message  
Host| Name of the domain or subdomain for which the log was generated  
Request Id| Unique identifier of request created only for runtime logs  
Request User Agent| Name of the browser from which the request originated  
Search Params| Search parameters of the request path  
Firewall| If request was allowed through firewall  
Edge Cache| Cache status with the values `HIT`, `MISS`, `STALE`, `BYPASS`, `PRERENDER` or `REVALIDATED`  
Middleware| Metadata about middleware execution such as location and external api  
Function| Metadata about function execution including function name, location, runtime, and duration  
Deployment| Metadata about the deployment that produced the logs including id, environment and branch  
Log Message| The bottom panel shows a list of log messages produced in chronological order  
### Show additional logs
Towards the end of the log results window is a button called Show New Logs. By default, it is set to display log results for the past 30 minutes.
Click this button, and it loads new log rows. The latest entries are added based on the selected filters.
## Log sharing
You can share a log entry with other team members to view the particular log and context you are looking at. Click on the log you want to share, copy the current URL of your browser, and send it to team members through the medium of your choice.
## Limits
Logs are streamed. Each `log` output can be up to 256KB, and each request can log up to 1MB of data in total, with a limit of 256 individual log lines per request. If you exceed the log entry limits, you can only query the most recent logs.
Runtime logs are stored with the following observability limits:
Plan| Retention time  
---|---  
Hobby| 1 hour of logs  
Pro| 1 day of logs  
Enterprise| 3 days of logs  
The above limits are applied immediately when upgrading plans. For example, if you upgrade from Hobby to Pro, you will have access to the Pro plan limits, and access historical logs for up to 1 day.
