Vercel Blob
# Vercel Blob
Vercel Blob is a scalable, and cost-effective object storage service for static assets, such as images, videos, audio files, and more.
Table of Contents
Vercel Blob is available in Beta on Hobby and Pro plans
Those with the owner, member, developer role can access this feature
## Use cases
Vercel Blob is a great solution for storing blobs that need to be frequently read. Here are some examples suitable for Vercel Blob:
  * Files that are programmatically uploaded or generated at build time, for display and download such as avatars, screenshots, cover images and videos
  * Large files such as videos and audios to take advantage of the global network
  * Files that you would normally store in an external file storage solution like Amazon S3. With your project hosted on Vercel, you can readily access and manage these files with Vercel Blob


## Getting started
You can create and manage your Vercel Blob stores from your account dashboard. You can scope your Vercel Blob stores to your Hobby team or team, and connect them to as many projects as you want.
To get started, see the server-side, or client-side quickstart guides.
## Using Vercel Blob in your workflow
If you'd like to know whether or not Vercel Blob can be integrated into your workflow, it's worth knowing the following:
  * You can have one or more Vercel Blob stores per Vercel account
  * You can use multiple Vercel Blob stores in one Vercel project
  * Each Vercel Blob store can be accessed by multiple Vercel projects
  * Vercel Blob URLs are publicly accessible, created with an unguessable random id, and immutable
  * To add to or remove from the content of a Blob store, a valid token is required


## Server and client uploads
There are two ways to upload files to Vercel Blob:
  1. Server uploads: This is the most common way to upload files. The file is first sent to your server and then to Vercel Blob. It's straightforward to implement, but you are limited to the request body your server can handle. Which in case of a Vercel-hosted website is 4.5 MB. This means you can't upload files larger than 4.5 MB on Vercel when using this method.
  2. Client uploads: This is a more advanced solution for when you need to upload larger files. The file is securely sent directly from the client (a browser for example) to Vercel Blob. This requires a bit more work to implement, but it allows you to upload files up to 5 TB (5,000 GB).


You can also upload files larger than 4.5 MB directly from a script or server code, as long as the file isn't received from a Vercel-hosted website. An example of that would be a server-side `fetch()` request streaming the response to Vercel Blob.
## Security
Vercel Blob URLs, although publicly accessible, are unique and hard to guess. They are composed of a unique store id, a pathname and a unique random blob id generated when the blob is created.
This is similar to  Share a file publicly  in Google Docs. You should ensure that the URLs are only shared to authorized users
Headers that enhance security by preventing unauthorized downloads, blocking external content from being embedded, and protecting against malicious file type manipulation, are enforced on each blob. They are:
  * `content-security-policy`: `default-src "none"`
  * `x-frame-options`: `DENY`
  * `x-content-type-options`: `nosniff`
  * `content-disposition`: `attachment/inline; filename="filename.extension"`


### Encryption
All files stored on Vercel Blob are secured using AES-256 encryption. This encryption process is applied at rest and is transparent, ensuring that files are encrypted before being saved to the disk and decrypted upon retrieval.
## Viewing and downloading blobs
Each Blob is served with a `content-disposition` header. Based on the MIME type of the uploaded file, it is either set to `attachment` (force file download) or `inline` (can render in a browser tab). This is done to prevent hosting specific files on `@vercel/blob` like HTML web pages. Your browser will automatically download the file instead of displaying it for these cases.
Currently `text/plain`, `text/xml`, `application/json`, `application/pdf`, `image/*`, `audio/*` and `video/*` resolve to a `content-disposition: inline` header.
All other MIME types default to `content-disposition: attachment`.
If you need a blob URL that always forces a download you can use the `downloadUrl` property on the blob object. This URL always has the `content-disposition: attachment` header no matter its MIME type.
```
import { list } from'@vercel/blob';
exportdefaultasyncfunctionPage() {
constresponse=awaitlist();
return (
  <>
   {response.blobs.map((blob) => (
    <akey={blob.pathname} href={blob.downloadUrl}>
     {blob.pathname}
    </a>
   ))}
  </>
 );
}
```

Alternatively the SDK exposes a helper function called `getDownloadUrl` that returns the same URL.
## Caching
Vercel Blobs have two levels of caching:
  1. In browsers: Blobs are cached for one year.
  2. In Vercel's edge network: Blobs are cached for 5 minutes.


The 5-minute edge cache is important when you're updating or deleting blobs:
  * If you override (update) a blob, it may take up to 5 minutes for the changes to be visible.
  * If you delete a blob, it may still be accessible for up to 5 minutes.


However, when you create a new blob, it's available immediately without any caching delay, as it doesn't exist in the cache yet.
You can configure this caching behavior by using the `cacheControlMaxAge` option on the `put()` method.
The minimum value is 0 second for browser and edge cache. The maximum value is 5 minutes (300 seconds) for edge cache and unlimited for browser cache.
The query string on the blob URL is not part of the cache key, meaning you cannot bypass the cache by adding a unique query string to the URL. To bypass the cache, upload a new version of your file with a different pathname.
Note: when serving blobs from the edge cache, we do not increment the number of basic operations, we only bill for the used bandwidth.
## Folders and slashes
Vercel Blob has folders support to organize your files:
```
constblob=awaitput('folder/file.txt','Hello World!', { access:'public' });
```

The path `folder/file.txt` creates a folder named `folder` and a blob file named `file.txt`. To list all blobs within a folder, use the `list` function:
```
constlistOfBlobs=awaitlist({
 cursor,
 limit:1000,
 prefix:'folder/',
});
```

You don't need to create folders. Upload a file with a path containing a slash `/`, and Vercel Blob will interpret the slashes as folder delimiters.
In the Vercel Blob file browser on the Vercel dashboard, any pathname with a slash `/` is treated as a folder. However, these are not actual folders like in a traditional file system; they are used for organizing blobs in listings and the file browser.
## Range requests
Vercel Blob supports range requests for partial downloads. This means you can download only a portion of a blob, here are examples:
Terminal
```
curlhttps://1sxstfwepd7zn41q.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/range-requests.txt
# 0123456789
# First 5 bytes
curl-r0-4https://1sxstfwepd7zn41q.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/range-requests.txt
# 01234
# Last 5 bytes
curl-r-5https://1sxstfwepd7zn41q.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/range-requests.txt
# 56789
# Bytes 3-6
curl-r3-6https://1sxstfwepd7zn41q.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/range-requests.txt
# 3456
```

## Upload progress
You can track the upload progress when uploading blobs with the `onUploadProgress` callback:
```
constblob=awaitupload('big-file.mp4', file, {
 access:'public',
 handleUploadUrl:'/api/upload',
onUploadProgress: (progressEvent) => {
console.log(`Loaded ${progressEvent.loaded} bytes`);
console.log(`Total ${progressEvent.total} bytes`);
console.log(`Percentage ${progressEvent.percentage}%`);
 },
});
```

`onUploadProgress` is available on `put` and `upload` methods.
## Aborting requests
Every Vercel Blob operation can be canceled, just like a fetch call. This is useful when you want to abort an ongoing operation, for example, when a user navigates away from a page or when the request takes too long.
```
constabortController=newAbortController();
try {
constblobPromise=vercelBlob.put('hello.txt','Hello World!', {
  access:'public',
  abortSignal:abortController.signal,
 });
consttimeout=setTimeout(() => {
// Abort the request after 1 second
abortController.abort();
 },1000);
constblob=await blobPromise;
console.info('blob put request completed', blob);
clearTimeout(timeout);
returnblob.url;
} catch (error) {
if (error instanceofvercelBlob.BlobRequestAbortedError) {
// Handle the abort
console.info('canceled put request');
 }
// Handle other errors
}
```

## Deleting all blobs
If, for some reason, you want to delete all the blobs in your store, do this:
```
import { list, del } from'@vercel/blob';
asyncfunctiondeleteAllBlobs() {
let cursor;
do {
constlistResult=awaitlist({
   cursor,
   limit:1000,
  });
if (listResult.blobs.length>0) {
awaitdel(listResult.blobs.map((blob) =>blob.url));
  }
  cursor =listResult.cursor;
 } while (cursor);
console.log('All blobs were deleted');
}
deleteAllBlobs().catch((error) => {
console.error('An error occurred:', error);
});
```

## Backups
While there's no native backup system for Vercel Blob, here are two ways to backup your blobs:
  1. Continuous backup: When using Client Uploads you can leverage the `onUploadCompleted` callback from the `handleUpload` server-side function to save every Blob upload to another storage.
  2. Periodic backup: Using Cron Jobs and the Vercel Blob SDK you can periodically list all blobs and save them.


Here's an example implementation of a periodic backup as a Cron Job:
```
import { Readable } from"node:stream";
import { S3Client } from"@aws-sdk/client-s3";
import { list } from"@vercel/blob";
import { Upload } from"@aws-sdk/lib-storage";
importtype { NextRequest } from"next/server";
importtype { ReadableStream } from"node:stream/web";
exportasyncfunctionGET(request:NextRequest) {
constauthHeader=request.headers.get("authorization");
if (authHeader !==`Bearer ${process.env.CRON_SECRET}`) {
returnnewResponse("Unauthorized", {
   status:401,
  });
 }
consts3=newS3Client({
  region:"us-east-1",
 });
let cursor:string|undefined;
do {
constlistResult=awaitlist({
   cursor,
   limit:250,
  });
if (listResult.blobs.length>0) {
awaitPromise.all(
listResult.blobs.map(async (blob) => {
constres=awaitfetch(blob.url);
if (res.body) {
constparallelUploads3=newUpload({
       client: s3,
       params: {
        Bucket:"vercel-blob-backup",
        Key:blob.pathname,
        Body:Readable.fromWeb(res.body asReadableStream),
       },
       leavePartsOnError:false,
      });
awaitparallelUploads3.done();
     }
    })
   );
  }
  cursor =listResult.cursor;
 } while (cursor);
returnnewResponse("Backup done!");
}
```

This script is optimized to not buffer all the files content into memory but to stream the content directly from Vercel Blob to the backup storage.
You can split your backup process into smaller chunks if you're hitting an execution limit. In this case you would save the `cursor` to a database and resume the backup process from where it left off.
