# Pricing on Vercel
Learn about Vercel's pricing model, including the resources and services that are billed, and how they are priced.
Table of Contents
This page provides an overview of Vercel's pricing model and outlines all billable metrics and their pricing models.
For a full breakdown of Vercel's pricing by plan, see the pricing page.
To learn how resources are triggered through a real-world app scenario, see the calculating resource usage guide.
## Managed Infrastructure
Vercel provides Managed Infrastructure to deploy, scale, and secure your applications.
This includes our Edge Network, Vercel Functions, and more. These resources are usage based, and billed based on the amount of data transferred, the number of requests made, and the duration of compute resources used.
Each product's usage breaks down into resources, with each one billed based on the usage of a specific metric. For example, within the Edge Network, Fast Data Transfer incurs charges based on the data transferred between the user's device and the Vercel Edge Network.
Similarly, Function Duration generates bills based on the total execution time of a Serverless Function.
### Managed Infrastructure billable resources
Most resources include an amount of usage your projects can use within your billing cycle. If you exceed the included amount, you are charged for the extra usage at the rates specified in the table below. The Pro add-on badge indicates resources available at an extra cost. See Pro plan add-ons for more information.
For Enterprise pricing, contact our sales team.
