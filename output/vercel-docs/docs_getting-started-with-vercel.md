Tutorial
# Get started with Vercel
This step-by-step tutorial will help you get started with Vercel, an end-to-end platform for developers that allows you to create and deploy your web application.
Table of Contents
Vercel is a platform for developers that provides the tools, workflows, and infrastructure you need to build and deploy your web apps faster, without the need for additional configuration.
Vercel supports popular frontend frameworks out-of-the-box, and its scalable, secure infrastructure is globally distributed to serve content from data centers near your users for optimal speeds.
During development, Vercel provides tools for real-time collaboration on your projects such as automatic preview and production environments, and comments on preview deployments.
## Before you begin
To get started, create an account with Vercel. You can select the plan that's right for you.
### Sign up
If you've never used Vercel before, sign up for a new Vercel account
### Log in
If you already have a Vercel account, log in to get started
Once you create an account, you can choose to authenticate either with a Git provider or by using an email. When using email authentication, you may need to confirm both your email address and a phone number.
## Customizing your journey
This tutorial is framework agnostic but Vercel supports many frontend frameworks. As you go through the docs, the quickstarts will provide specific instructions for your framework. If you don't find what you need, give us feedback and we'll update them!
While many of our instructions use the dashboard, you can also use Vercel CLI to carry out most tasks on Vercel. In this tutorial, look for the "Using CLI?" section for the CLI steps. To use the CLI, you'll need to install it:
pnpmyarnnpm
```
pnpm i -g vercel
```
