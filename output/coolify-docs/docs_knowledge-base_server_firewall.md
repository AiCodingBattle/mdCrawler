# Firewall ​
## Self-hosted version ​
For self-hosting Coolify, you need to allow some ports on your firewall.
  * For Coolify: `8000` (http), `6001` (websocket), `6002` (terminal), and `22` (SSH, or a custom port) (required)


Tip
8000, 6001, 6002 can be closed when accessing Coolify through a domain and using the integrated reverse proxy (Traefik or Caddy).
  * Reverse Proxy: `80, 443` (optional)


Caution
If you are using `Oracle Cloud Free ARM Server`, you need to allow these ports inside Oracle's Dashboard, otherwise you cannot reach your instance from the internet after installation.
### GitHub integration ​
  * Detailed Guide.


#### Webhooks ​
You need to allow TCP port `80` or `443` for GitHub webhooks.
To specify the IP addresses (optional), you can use the following API endpoint to get them:
  * https://api.github.com/meta - Check `hooks` section.


### Terminal ​
Since 4.0.0-beta.336, you need to allow TCP port `6002` for terminal access on `/terminal` endpoint.
Tip
If you are using the integrated reverse proxy (Traefik or Caddy), the terminal is accessible on `https://your-domain.com/terminal` with dynamic proxy configuration.
## Cloud version ​
