# Choosing Your Way to Use Coolify ​
There are 2 ways to use coolify:
  * Coolify Cloud ↗ (starts at $5/mo)
  * **Self Host Coolify** (fully free forever)


## Coolify Cloud ​
The cloud option is the easiest way to get started with Coolify.
It is a paid service, where you can bring your own servers to a hosted Coolify instance.
We will manage the coolify instance for you, so you can focus on shipping your apps.
## Coolify Self-Hosted ​
You get all the features of the cloud version in the self-hosted version, but you need to take care of the maintenance of Coolify, all related servers and services yourself.
We don't lock certain features only for cloud version like most open source projects do, all features of Coolify are avalible both Self Hosted and Cloud Version
