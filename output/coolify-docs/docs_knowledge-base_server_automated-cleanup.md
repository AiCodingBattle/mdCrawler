# Automated Docker Cleanup ​
Coolify includes an automated Docker cleanup feature to prevent servers from running out of disk space. This guide explains how to configure it and what it does.
## Configuration ​
You can configure the automated cleanup under: `Servers` > `YOUR_SERVER` > `Configuration` > `Advanced`
### Available Settings ​
  1. **Docker Cleanup Threshold**
     * Sets the disk percentage threshold that triggers the cleanup.
     * Example: If set to 80%, cleanup will be triggered when disk usage exceeds 80%.
  2. **Docker Cleanup Frequency**
     * Schedule cleanups using cron expressions when `Force Docker Cleanup` is enabled.


Tip
  * We recommend enabling `Force Docker Cleanup` and scheduling cleanups using cron syntax.
  * This provides more reliable cleanup behavior compared to relying on a disk threshold.


  1. **Optional Cleanups**
     * Enable unused volumes cleanup (note: this can lead to data loss).
     * Enable unused networks cleanup.


## How It Works ​
### Safety Measures ​
  * If there is an ongoing deployment, the cleanup will not be triggered to prevent any issues, like deleting the image that is currently being used.
  * Only Coolify-managed resources are affected.


### Cleanup Process ​
When triggered (either by schedule or disk threshold), the system performs the following actions:
  * Removes stopped containers managed by Coolify (no data loss as containers are non-persistent).
  * Deletes unused Docker images.
  * Clears Docker build cache.
  * Removes old versions of Coolify helper images.
  * Removes unused Docker volumes (if enabled).
  * Removes unused Docker networks (if enabled).
