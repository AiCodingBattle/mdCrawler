# Oracle Cloud ​
If you are using `Oracle Cloud free ARM server`, you need to do a few extra steps to use it in Coolify, as a `Coolify instance` or just a `remote server`.
## Normal user ​
Non-root user is in `experimental` mode and works with `sudo`.
  * Make sure the ssh key is added to the user's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.
  * All configuration is set for sudo. Details here.


## Setup Root User ​
By default, you can't login as root user. You need to do the following steps to enable root user.
  1. Switch to root user `sudo su -`
  2. Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and change `PermitRootLogin` to `without-password`.
  3. Restart ssh service `service sshd restart`
  4. Add a public key to `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` file which is also defined in your Coolify instance.


## Firewall Rules ​
This is only required if you self-host Coolify on Oracle ARM server.
By default, Oracle ARM server has a firewall enabled and you need to allow some ports to use Coolify.
For more details, check this page.
