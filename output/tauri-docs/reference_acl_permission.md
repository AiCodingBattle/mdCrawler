# Permission
Descriptions of explicit privileges of commands.
It can enable commands to be accessible in the frontend of the application.
If the scope is defined it can be used to fine grain control the access of individual or multiple commands.
**Object Properties** :
  * commands
  * description
  * identifier (required)
  * platforms
  * scope
  * version


### commands
`Commands`
Allowed or denied commands when using this permission.
Default```

{
"allow": [],
"deny": []
}

```

### description
`string` | `null`

### version
`integer` | `null` minimum of `1`, formatted as `uint64`

## Definitions

  * `number` formatted as `double` Represents a [`f64`].


A valid ACL number.
### Scopes
An argument for fine grained behavior control of Tauri commands.
It can be of any serde serializable type and is used to allow or prevent certain actions inside a Tauri command. The configured scope is passed to the command and will be enforced by the command implementation.
##### Example
```

{
"allow": [{ "path": "$HOME/**" }],
"deny": [{ "path": "$HOME/secret.txt" }]
}

```

**Object Properties** :
  * allow
  * deny


##### allow
`Value`[] | `null`
Data that defines what is allowed by the scope.
##### deny
`Value`[] | `null`
Data that defines what is denied by the scope. This should be prioritized by validation logic.
### Target

  * `"macOS"` MacOS.
  * `"windows"` Windows.
  * `"linux"` Linux.

  * `"iOS"` iOS.


Platform target.
