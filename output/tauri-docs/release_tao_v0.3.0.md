  * **Breaking change** : New keyboard API, including `Accelerator` and `GlobalShortcut`.

`WindowEvent::KeyboardInput` as been refactored and is exposing the event `KeyEvent`.
All menus (`ContextMenu` and `MenuBar`), now includes `Accelerator` support on Windows, macOS and Linux.
New modules available: `keyboard`, `accelerator` and `platform::global_shortcut`.
_Please refer to the docs and examples for more details._
